# OS_Project1
In this project, you should add a new system call to the Android kernel(Linux). The system call you write should take two arguments and return the process tree information in a depth-first-search (DFS) order.


To know What you should do in detail, you can refer to the PDF file "*cs356project1*" and "*CS156-Project1*" .
